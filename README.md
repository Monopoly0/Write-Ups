# Write-Ups
This is where I will upload all of my write-ups. I will also upload my CherryTree sqlite database files along with them so if you possess the cherrytree software you can view my work in the most organized fashion instead of a generated pdf file.

^There is the source code of cherrytree if you prefer looking at my notes that way. Keep in mind 90% of my write-ups use cherrytree (I sometimes get lazy and just open up nano and write my notes in markdown format if the machines I am doing are too eazy).

Hit me up on Discord if you need any specific scans or etc....

Enjoy :)

PS: I try to obsfucate any creds or flags that could violate TOS of any of the sites I use to produce my write-ups, so if you're trying to get meaningless internet points your at the wrong place XD.
